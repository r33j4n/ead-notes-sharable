The Decorator Design Pattern is a structural pattern that allows behavior to be added to an individual object, either statically or dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class. It is used to extend the functionalities of classes in a flexible and reusable way.

**Key Components:**

1. **Component:**
   - Defines the interface for objects that can have responsibilities added or removed dynamically.
   - Usually, it's an interface or an abstract class.

2. **Concrete Component:**
   - Implements the `Component` interface.
   - Represents the core functionality to which additional responsibilities can be attached.

3. **Decorator:**
   - Maintains a reference to a `Component` object.
   - Implements the `Component` interface to match the interface of the wrapped component.
   - Can add or override behavior before or after delegating to the wrapped component.

4. **Concrete Decorator:**
   - Extends the behavior of the `Decorator` class.
   - Adds specific responsibilities to the component.

**Example Code:**

Let's consider a simple example of a coffee shop where we have a basic coffee (`Coffee`), and we want to add optional condiments (decorators) like milk and sugar.

```java
// Component interface
interface Coffee {
    String getDescription();
    double cost();
}

// Concrete Component
class SimpleCoffee implements Coffee {
    @Override
    public String getDescription() {
        return "Simple Coffee";
    }

    @Override
    public double cost() {
        return 2.0;
    }
}

// Decorator
abstract class CoffeeDecorator implements Coffee {
    protected Coffee decoratedCoffee;

    public CoffeeDecorator(Coffee decoratedCoffee) {
        this.decoratedCoffee = decoratedCoffee;
    }

    @Override
    public String getDescription() {
        return decoratedCoffee.getDescription();
    }

    @Override
    public double cost() {
        return decoratedCoffee.cost();
    }
}

// Concrete Decorator
class MilkDecorator extends CoffeeDecorator {
    public MilkDecorator(Coffee decoratedCoffee) {
        super(decoratedCoffee);
    }

    @Override
    public String getDescription() {
        return super.getDescription() + ", Milk";
    }

    @Override
    public double cost() {
        return super.cost() + 0.5;
    }
}

// Concrete Decorator
class SugarDecorator extends CoffeeDecorator {
    public SugarDecorator(Coffee decoratedCoffee) {
        super(decoratedCoffee);
    }

    @Override
    public String getDescription() {
        return super.getDescription() + ", Sugar";
    }

    @Override
    public double cost() {
        return super.cost() + 0.2;
    }
}

// Client code
public class DecoratorClient {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a simple coffee
        Coffee simpleCoffee = new SimpleCoffee();
        System.out.println("Description: " + simpleCoffee.getDescription());
        System.out.println("Cost: $" + simpleCoffee.cost());
        System.out.println();

        // Add milk to the coffee
        Coffee milkCoffee = new MilkDecorator(simpleCoffee);
        System.out.println("Description: " + milkCoffee.getDescription());
        System.out.println("Cost: $" + milkCoffee.cost());
        System.out.println();

        // Add sugar to the coffee
        Coffee sweetCoffee = new SugarDecorator(milkCoffee);
        System.out.println("Description: " + sweetCoffee.getDescription());
        System.out.println("Cost: $" + sweetCoffee.cost());
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

- The `Coffee` interface defines the basic operations for a coffee.
- `SimpleCoffee` is a concrete component that implements the basic coffee.
- `CoffeeDecorator` is the decorator class, implementing the `Coffee` interface. It maintains a reference to a `Coffee` object.
- `MilkDecorator` and `SugarDecorator` are concrete decorators adding specific responsibilities (milk and sugar) to the coffee.

**How it Works:**

1. **Component Interface (`Coffee`):**
   - Declares the common interface for both simple components and decorators.

2. **Concrete Component (`SimpleCoffee`):**
   - Implements the basic functionality.

3. **Decorator (`CoffeeDecorator`):**
   - Maintains a reference to a `Coffee` object.
   - Implements the common interface, forwarding calls to the wrapped component.

4. **Concrete Decorators (`MilkDecorator`, `SugarDecorator`):**
   - Add specific responsibilities (milk, sugar) to the component.
   - Override or extend methods as needed.

**Why it is Used:**

1. **Dynamic Behavior Extension:**
   - **Explanation:** Decorators allow you to dynamically add or override behavior at runtime without modifying existing code.
   - **Example:** In the provided example, you can add milk, sugar, or other condiments to a basic coffee without changing the `SimpleCoffee` class.

2. **Open/Closed Principle:**
   - **Explanation:** The Decorator pattern follows the open/closed principle, allowing you to extend functionality without modifying existing code.
   - **Example:** New decorators (e.g., adding whipped cream) can be added without changing the existing components.

3. **Composition over Inheritance:**
   - **Explanation:** Decorators use composition, allowing you to compose objects with different combinations of responsibilities.
   - **Example:** You can create complex combinations of decorators to achieve different variations of behavior.

4. **Reusable Components:**
   - **Explanation:** Decorators are reusable, and you can mix and match them to create different combinations of behavior.
   - **Example:** The `MilkDecorator` and `SugarDecorator` can be used with different components, not just with `SimpleCoffee`.

**Use Cases:**

1. **Text Formatting:**
   - **Scenario:** In a text processing system, where you have a basic text component and decorators for formatting (bold, italic, underline).
   - **Example:** Applying different decorators to a text component to achieve various formatting options.

2. **Windowing Systems:**
   - **Scenario:** In a graphical user interface, where you have a basic window component and decorators for adding scroll bars, borders, etc.
   - **Example:** Adding decorators to a window to provide additional features without modifying the window class.

3. **I/O Streams:**
   - **Scenario:** In Java's I/O framework, where you have basic stream components (e.g., `FileInputStream`) and decorators for additional functionality (e.g., buffering with `BufferedInputStream`).
   - **Example:** Wrapping a basic input stream with decorators to add buffering, compression, or encryption.

**Learning and Recall:**

- Understand the roles of `Component`, `Concrete Component`, `Decorator`, and `Concrete Decorator` in the pattern.
- Recognize the benefits of using decorators for dynamic behavior extension.
- Visualize scenarios where the Decorator pattern is beneficial, especially in situations where you want to extend functionality without modifying existing code.

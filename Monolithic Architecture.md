1. **Definition:**
    
    - Monolithic architecture is a traditional approach to building software where the entire application is developed as a single, indivisible unit.
2. **Characteristics:**
    
    - All components (user interface, business logic, and data access) are tightly integrated into a single codebase.
    - A single deployment unit, and the entire application is deployed as one unit.
    - Typically, a single technology stack is used for development.
3. **Use Cases:**
    
    - Small to medium-sized applications.
    - Applications with limited scalability requirements.
    - Projects with straightforward development and deployment needs.
4. **Advantages:**
    
    - **Simplicity:** Easier to develop and deploy due to a single codebase.
    - **Maintenance:** Easier to maintain as there's only one application to manage.
    - **Development Speed:** Faster development as there's no need to manage separate services.
5. **Disadvantages:**
    
    - **Scalability Issues:** Challenges in scaling as the entire application needs to be scaled.
    - **Flexibility:** Limited flexibility in choosing technologies for different components.
    - **Updates:** Updates may require downtime and impact the entire application.
6. **Example Scenario:**
    
    - Developing a content management system (CMS) where all components, including user interface, content processing, and database access, are tightly integrated into a single application.
7. **Technology Stack (Example):**
    
    - **Backend:** Java with Spring Framework.
    - **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript with a server-rendered approach.
    - **Database:** MySQL or PostgreSQL.
8. **How to Remember:**
    
    - Visualize a "monolith" as a single, solid structure. In the context of software architecture, it represents an application that is tightly integrated into one unit.
9. **Exam Tips:**
    
    - Understand the characteristics and use cases of Monolithic Architecture.
    - Be aware of the advantages and disadvantages.
    - Consider scenarios where a monolithic approach is suitable.

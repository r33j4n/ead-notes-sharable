1. **Definition:**
    
    >Serverless architecture is a cloud computing execution model where the cloud provider automatically manages the infrastructure, and developers focus on writing code without worrying about server provisioning, scaling, or maintenance.


1. **Characteristics:**
    
    - No need to manage servers; the cloud provider handles infrastructure tasks.
    - Event-driven model, where functions (serverless units of execution) are triggered by events.
    - Pay-per-execution pricing model.

1. **Use Cases:**
    
    - **Event-Driven Applications:** Applications that respond to events, such as data changes, user actions, or external triggers.
    - **Microservices:** Serverless functions can be used for specific microservices in a larger architecture.
    - **Periodic Tasks:** Scheduled functions for periodic tasks like data backups or cleanup.
4. **Advantages:**
    
    - **Cost-Efficiency:** Pay only for the actual function executions; no cost during idle times.
    - **Scalability:** Automatically scales with the number of incoming events.
    - **Developer Productivity:** Focus on writing code without managing infrastructure.
    - **Quick Deployment:** Functions can be deployed independently and quickly.
5. **Disadvantages:**
    
    - **Cold Start Latency:** Functions may experience latency during the initial invocation.
    - **Limited Execution Time:** Functions typically have a maximum execution time (e.g., 15 minutes).
    - **Statelessness:** Functions are designed to be stateless, requiring external storage for persistent data.
6. **Example Scenario:**
    
    - Developing a web application where serverless functions handle user authentication, image processing, and sending notifications based on user interactions.
7. **Technology Stack (Example):**
    
    - **Cloud Provider:** AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, Google Cloud Functions.
    - **Programming Languages:** Supports various languages, including Node.js, Python, Java, and more.
    - **Event Sources:** Events can be triggered by API Gateway, database changes, file uploads, etc.
8. **How to Remember:**
    
    - Visualize the term "serverless" as the absence of servers that you need to manage. In a serverless architecture, the cloud provider takes care of server-related tasks.
9. **Exam Tips:**
    
    - Understand the characteristics and benefits of serverless architecture.
    - Be aware of common use cases and scenarios where serverless is suitable.
    - Know the limitations and potential challenges, such as cold start latency.

Remember, **serverless architecture is well-suited for event-driven applications with sporadic workloads and is particularly cost-efficient for applications with variable usage patterns**.

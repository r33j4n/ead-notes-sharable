### Monolithic Architecture
- **Definition:** A single-tiered software application where different components are combined into a single program.
- **Example:** Traditional e-commerce platforms where all functionalities (catalog, shopping cart, checkout) are tightly integrated.
- **Learning Tip:** Visualize a monolith as a single large block of functionality; changes may impact the entire structure.

### Microservices Architecture
- **Definition:** A software architectural style where a large application is divided into small, independent services that communicate via APIs.
- **Example:** Netflix, where different microservices handle user authentication, recommendation, and video streaming.
- **Learning Tip:** Picture microservices as small, specialized tools working together; each tool performs a specific job.

### Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)
- **Definition:** An architectural pattern where application components provide services to other components over a network.
- **Example:** An airline system with separate services for booking, payment, and flight information.
- **Learning Tip:** Think of services as independent units providing specific functionalities; they collaborate to achieve a common goal.

### Event-Driven Architecture
- **Definition:** A system design where components communicate by producing or consuming events.
- **Example:** Stock trading platforms where price changes trigger events, updating multiple components.
- **Learning Tip:** Imagine events as messages that trigger specific actions across different parts of the system.

### Layered Architecture
- **Definition:** An architectural pattern where components are organized into horizontal layers (presentation, business logic, data access).
- **Example:** Java EE applications often have separate layers for handling user input, processing logic, and interacting with databases.
- **Learning Tip:** Picture layers as stacked functionalities; each layer performs a specific set of tasks.

### Serverless Architecture
- **Definition:** An execution model where cloud providers manage infrastructure, and developers focus on writing code.
- **Example:** AWS Lambda, where code runs in response to events without the need for maintaining servers.
- **Learning Tip:** Envision serverless as writing code and letting the cloud provider handle the server-related complexities.

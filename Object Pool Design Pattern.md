**Object Pool Design Pattern:**
The Object Pool Design Pattern is a creational pattern that manages a pool of reusable objects. Instead of creating and destroying objects each time they are needed, the pattern allows for recycling and reusing existing objects. This can be particularly useful in scenarios where creating and destroying objects is resource-intensive.

**Key Components:**
1. **ObjectPool:** Manages a pool of objects and provides a mechanism to acquire and release them.
2. **PooledObject:** Represents the objects stored in the pool. It typically contains the actual object along with additional metadata.
3. **Client:** Requests objects from the ObjectPool and releases them when done.

**Example Code:**
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

// PooledObject class
class PooledObject {
    private boolean inUse;
    private Object object;

    public PooledObject(Object object) {
        this.object = object;
    }

    public boolean isInUse() {
        return inUse;
    }

    public void setInUse(boolean inUse) {
        this.inUse = inUse;
    }

    public Object getObject() {
        return object;
    }
}

// ObjectPool class
class ObjectPool<T> {
    private List<PooledObject> pool;
    private ObjectFactory<T> objectFactory;

    public ObjectPool(ObjectFactory<T> objectFactory, int poolSize) {
        this.objectFactory = objectFactory;
        this.pool = new ArrayList<>(poolSize);
        initializePool(poolSize);
    }

    private void initializePool(int poolSize) {
        for (int i = 0; i < poolSize; i++) {
            T object = objectFactory.createObject();
            PooledObject pooledObject = new PooledObject(object);
            pool.add(pooledObject);
        }
    }

    public synchronized T acquireObject() {
        for (PooledObject pooledObject : pool) {
            if (!pooledObject.isInUse()) {
                pooledObject.setInUse(true);
                return (T) pooledObject.getObject();
            }
        }
        return null; // All objects are in use
    }

    public synchronized void releaseObject(T object) {
        for (PooledObject pooledObject : pool) {
            if (pooledObject.getObject() == object) {
                pooledObject.setInUse(false);
                break;
            }
        }
    }
}

// ObjectFactory interface
interface ObjectFactory<T> {
    T createObject();
}

// Example usage
class Connection {
    // Simulating a connection object
    private String connectionString;

    public Connection(String connectionString) {
        this.connectionString = connectionString;
    }

    public void executeQuery(String query) {
        System.out.println("Executing query '" + query + "' on connection " + connectionString);
    }
}

class ConnectionFactory implements ObjectFactory<Connection> {
    @Override
    public Connection createObject() {
        // Simulating the creation of a connection object
        return new Connection("New Connection");
    }
}

public class ObjectPoolExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ObjectPool<Connection> connectionPool = new ObjectPool<>(new ConnectionFactory(), 5);

        // Acquire and use connections
        Connection connection1 = connectionPool.acquireObject();
        connection1.executeQuery("SELECT * FROM table1");

        Connection connection2 = connectionPool.acquireObject();
        connection2.executeQuery("UPDATE table2 SET column1 = value");

        // Release connections back to the pool
        connectionPool.releaseObject(connection1);
        connectionPool.releaseObject(connection2);

        // Acquire and use more connections
        Connection connection3 = connectionPool.acquireObject();
        connection3.executeQuery("INSERT INTO table3 VALUES (1, 'data')");

        // Release the connection back to the pool
        connectionPool.releaseObject(connection3);
    }
}
```

**Key Points:**
- The `ObjectPool` manages a pool of `PooledObject` instances, each containing an actual object and a flag indicating whether it's currently in use.
- The `ObjectFactory` interface defines a method to create new objects. In the example, `ConnectionFactory` implements `ObjectFactory` to create `Connection` objects.
- The `acquireObject` method of the `ObjectPool` is responsible for providing an available object from the pool, marking it as in use.
- The `releaseObject` method of the `ObjectPool` is used to return an object to the pool, marking it as available for reuse.
- Clients use the `acquireObject` and `releaseObject` methods to get and return objects from/to the pool.

**Use Cases:**
- Database connection pooling in web applications.
- Thread pooling in concurrent programming.
- Resource management in scenarios where creating and destroying objects is expensive.
- Any situation where the overhead of object creation is high, and object reuse can improve performance and resource utilization.

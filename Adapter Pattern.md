**Adapter Design Pattern:**
The Adapter Design Pattern is a structural pattern that allows the interface of an existing class to be used as another interface. It is often used to make existing classes work with others without modifying their source code. Adapters are particularly useful when integrating new features or systems that have incompatible interfaces.

**Key Components:**
1. **Target:** The interface that the client code expects. It defines the domain-specific interface that the client uses.
2. **Adaptee:** The existing class that needs to be integrated into the system. It has an interface that is incompatible with the client's expectations.
3. **Adapter:** A class that bridges the gap between the Target interface and the Adaptee interface. It implements the Target interface and delegates the actual work to the Adaptee.

**Example Code:**
```java
// Target interface
interface Target {
    void request();
}

// Adaptee (existing class with incompatible interface)
class Adaptee {
    void specificRequest() {
        System.out.println("Adaptee's specific request");
    }
}

// Adapter
class Adapter implements Target {
    private Adaptee adaptee;

    public Adapter(Adaptee adaptee) {
        this.adaptee = adaptee;
    }

    @Override
    public void request() {
        adaptee.specificRequest();
    }
}

// Client code
public class AdapterClient {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Using the Adapter to make Adaptee compatible with Target
        Adaptee adaptee = new Adaptee();
        Target adapter = new Adapter(adaptee);

        // The client code works with the Target interface
        adapter.request();
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**
- The `Target` interface defines the expected behavior that the client code works with.
- The `Adaptee` class is the existing class with an incompatible interface. It has a method named `specificRequest`.
- The `Adapter` class implements the `Target` interface and contains an instance of `Adaptee`. It delegates the `request` method to the `specificRequest` method of `Adaptee`.
- The client code interacts with the `Target` interface through an instance of the `Adapter` class.

**Why it is used:**
- **Legacy Code Integration:** When you need to integrate existing classes with incompatible interfaces into a new system.
- **Interface Conversion:** When you want to adapt an existing interface to meet the requirements of a new interface.
- **System Extensibility:** When you want to add new functionalities or features to an existing system without modifying existing code.

**Use Cases:**
1. **Library Integration:**
   - **Scenario:** You have a new library that expects an interface different from the one provided by an existing class.
   - **Adapter:** The adapter converts the interface of the existing class to the one expected by the library.

2. **Device Compatibility:**
   - **Scenario:** You have a device (e.g., a printer) with a specific interface, and you want to make it compatible with a new system.
   - **Adapter:** The adapter translates the commands from the system into commands that the device understands.

3. **Third-Party Frameworks:**
   - **Scenario:** You are using a third-party framework in your application, and its interface doesn't match the requirements of your code.
   - **Adapter:** An adapter is used to wrap the framework's classes and provide a suitable interface for your code.

**Learning and Recall:**
- Understand the distinction between the `Target`, `Adaptee`, and `Adapter`.
- Recognize that the Adapter pattern allows incompatible interfaces to work together.
- Visualize scenarios where the Adapter pattern is beneficial, such as integrating legacy code or making two incompatible systems communicate.
